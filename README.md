First iOS experiment

Hello Professor!

I believe the program is working properly, however it has been difficult to get the simulator to run properly in itself.
I have been getting the simulator pop-up without an app, but by all accounts (comparing code with other students)
everything I have is proper. Let me know if there are issues, I don't want my grade to suffer because of technical problems.
